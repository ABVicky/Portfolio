He has big dreams and he loves to chase them till fulfilment. A student who has always looked back with fond gratitude and has reverence for all. However Vicky's weakness is that he cannot accept NO for an answer. It is very important to inculcate this strength of being gracious of refusals. I wish Vicky the best of life as he keeps on escalating his skills. A talented boy who wins my heart with every encounter.
